# Save It - Chrome Extension
**Save It** is a productivity-enhancing Chrome extension designed to keep the things you need to copy-paste often handy. How do you find your resume link when someone asks you for it? I have been in this situation where I had to go around looking for some common text/URL every now and then just to copy-paste it somewhere else.
I was getting frustrated with time so I created this Chrome extension to keep snippets that I need often, handy.
